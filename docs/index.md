    <h2>We are holding a Summer School on PRS analyses!!</h2>

    - **[Polygenic Risk Score Analysis](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/sgdp-centre/study/summerschool/index.aspx) _(led by Dr. Paul O'Reily, Dr. Sam Choi)_**
        - *Thursday 21st June 2018*

PRSice (pronounced 'precise') is a Polygenic Risk Score software for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of polygenic risk scores (PRS) analyses.
Some of the features include:

1. High-resolution scoring (PRS calculated across a large number of P-value thresholds)
2. Most predictive PRS identified
3. Genotyped (PLINK binary) and imputed (Oxford bgen v1.2) data input
4. Biobank-scale unimputed data can be analysed within hours
5. Incorporation of covariates
6. Application across multiple target traits simultaneously
7. Results plotted in several formats (bar plots, high-res plots, quantile plots)
8. Empirical P-values output (not subject to over-fitting)
9. PRSet: function for calculating PRS across pathways / gene sets (user list option)

## R Packages Requirements

To plot graphs, PRSice requires [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (**version 3.2.3+**) installed.

[Additional steps](extra_steps.md) might be required for MAC and Window users.

!!! Note

    PRSice can automatically download all required packages, even without administrative right.
    You can specify the install directory using `--dir`. For example

    ```
        Rscript PRSice.R --dir .
    ```

    will install all required packages under the local directory

# Quick Start
For Quick start use, please refer to [Quick Start](quick_start.md)

!!! tip

    You can also type

    ```
        ./PRSice
    ```

    to view all available parameters unrelated to plotting, or

    ```
        Rscript PRSice.R -h
    ```

    to view all available parameters, including those used for plotting
