Currently we only support a SNP major PLINK input (default output of the latest PLINK program).\n\n\nThe \n.bed\n and \n.bim\n file must have the same prefix.\n\n\nIf you want to use a \n.fam\n file with a different prefix from the \n.bed\n and \n.bim\n file, you can do\n\n\n--target \nbim bed prefix\n,\nfam file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nYou MUST ensure the fam file contains the correct number of samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n-9 will NOT be considered as missing for quantitative traits\n\n\n\n\nIf your binary file is separated into individual chromosomes, then you can place an # in place of the chromosome number.\nPRSice will automatically substitute # with 1-22\n\n\ni.e. If your files are chr1.\n,chr2.\n,...,chr22.\n, just use\n\n\n--target chr#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf an external fam file is provided, the substitution will not be performed on it. This is because all chromosome should have the same fam file. fam file from any of the chromosome should be ok\n\n\n\n\nBGEN\n\n\nWe also support BGEN v1.2. To specify a BGEN file, you simply add \n--type bgen\n or \n--ld-type bgen\n to your PRSice command\n\n\nAs BGEN does not store the phenotype information and sometime not even the sample ID, you \nmust\n provide\na phenotype file (\n--pheno-file\n) for PRSice to run. Or you can provide a sample file using\n\n\n--target \nbgen prefix\n,\nsample file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe will still require this sample file even if you are doing \n--no-regress\n as we do want the sample ID.  we might loosen this requirement later on.\n\n\n\n\nWith BGEN, a number of other PRSice options become effective:\n- \n--hard\n: Normally, with BGEN format, we will calculate the PRS using the dosage information.\nBut you can ask for hard-thresholding by using the \n--hard\n option. Then we will code the SNP as the genotype with\nprobability larger than threshold specified by \n--hard-thres\n. If no such genotype is presented, the SNP will be\ncoded as missing\n- \n--hard-thres\n: The genotype probability threshold. SNPs with no genotype having a probability larger than this\nthreshold will be treated as missing\n\n\nPhenotype files\n\n\nSometimes, the phenotype information are not stored within the genotype files.\nIn this scenario, a phenotype file can be provided to PRSice using the \n--pheno-file\n\nparameter.\nThe first two column of the phenotype file should be the FID and the IID, or if\n\n--ignore-fid\n is set, the first column should be the IID.\nThe rest of the columns can be the phenotype(s).\n\n\nIf the user want to specify a trait within the phenotype file, the file must\ncontain a column header and the column name for the trait can be provided using\n\n--pheno-col\n parameter. Multiple column name can be provided via a comma separated\nlist: e.g. \n--pheno-col A,B,C,D\n. Trait(s) not found within the phenotype file will\nbe automatically skipped.\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nThe column name should not contain \nspace\n nor \ncomma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen multiple traits are provided, the column name will be appended to\nthe output prefix.\n\n\n\n\nLD reference\n\n\nWhen your target sample is small (e.g. \n 500 samples), you might want to use an external reference panel\nto improve the LD estimation for clumping.\n\n\nThe LD reference follows the same notion as the target dataset.
